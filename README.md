We provide a new code base. We applied a sift_v.py algorithms that has larger cluster size and therefore more accurate perfromance in predicting. 

To run the whole process, first built the required repository for ROS and TurtleBot. Then, follow the call process in the SIFT_readme.md in baseline_solution_V1_SIFT/ navigation/. Demos are saved for visualization.
